# velo2cam_calibration [![Build Status](https://build.ros.org/view/Ndev/job/Ndev__velo2cam_calibration__ubuntu_focal_amd64/badge/icon)](https://build.ros.org/view/Ndev/job/Ndev__velo2cam_calibration__ubuntu_focal_amd64/)

The *velo2cam_calibration* software implements a state-of-the-art automatic calibration algorithm for pair of sensors composed of LiDAR and camera devices in any possible combination \[1\]. This software is provided as a ROS package.

Package co-developed by [Carlos Guindel](https://cguindel.github.io/)

## Setup ##
To install this ROS package:
1. Clone the repository into your *catkin_ws/src/* folder.
2. Install run dependencies: ```sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-opencv-apps```
3. Build your workspace [as usual](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/BuildingPackages).

## Usage ##
See [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md) for detailed instructions on how to use this software.

To test the algorithm in a virtual environment, you can launch any of the calibration scenarios included in our [Gazebo validation suite](https://github.com/beltransen/velo2cam_gazebo).

## Calibration target ##
The following picture shows a possible embodiment of the proposed calibration target used by this algorithm and its corresponding dimensional drawing.
